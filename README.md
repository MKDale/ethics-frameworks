# Incorporating Ethical Thinking

The question of building an ethical digital product never contains just a simple yes or no, it is a conversation. By incorporating steps within the process to do deeper thinking around potential outcomes, teams can come to not only understand their impact on an individual user but on a neighborhood, a community, a country, or the world.

These exercises are a follow on to the [Hippocratic Oath for Technologists](https://mkdale.github.io/techoath/) which was released in April of 2018. The short list of exercises to the left, work together or alone and help cross-functional teams gain comprehension of how the collective and the individuals involved feel about the impact they will make in releasing the product into the world.


## Work in Progress

These frameworks are open sourced and a work in progress. They assume an equal power dynmaic between members of a digital product team and that they would be completed as a group, not by a single individual.
