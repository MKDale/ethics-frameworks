# The Blanchard-Peale

Products aren’t always used as intended. Upon release and throughout its lifecycle the use of a product may change or include outcomes that were not necessarily intended due to its nature of being a part of a larger social ecosystem. As crafts people it is our responsibility to monitor & understand how a product is *actually* used in the real world, and not just assume intended outcomes. Whether we are the original creator or joined the product team at a later point in time, there should be a responsibility to knowing and being connected in this way. This exercise is inspired by the 1988 book, [The Power of Ethical Management](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Ethical-Management-Norman-Peale/dp/0688070620), by Norman V Peale and Ken Blanchard.

## How:

1. Draw three, large verticle sections on a whiteboard.
2. Label them at the top from left to right: "Is it legal?", "Is it fair?", "How does it make me feel?"
3. Beginning on the left side with Legal, give the prompt to the group, "Does this product comply with government laws? Does it comply with our own organization’s internal regulations or requirements?"
4. Split into pairs or groups of 3 to research either gov or org questions together. Come back all together after 15 min.
5. Gather 3 piles of stickies: one green, one yellow, one red. Each person gets one stack of each color. Use the stickies to vote. Red=Stop, Yellow=Concern, Green=Go.
6. Give the initial prompt one more time, and allow each person to come to the board to vote with a red, yellow, or green stickie.
7. Repeat the same steps with the second and third columns. For the Fair column, give the prompt, “Would others view decision as honest & honorable? Are one or more affected parties being treated without consideration or respect? Is someone getting an advantage that others are not?”. For the Feel column give the prompt, “What is your gut feeling, positive, negative or in between, about this product? How would people react if they saw it in the news?”
8. Take time & give time for reflection after the second and third prompts, 5min per columm. Next vote, as per above. This will be very similar to a retro facilitation. Discuss what, why & whos of yellows and reds. 
9. Option to follow up with 
[Insights & Actions](http://www.designkit.org/methods/62) if desired.

### Note: 
Group alignment is not the goal for this exercise (and many others in Ethics frameworks). The priority is to develop individual understanding and provoke thought. Delving into and understanding personal, group/team, organizational, and government views is the objective.
