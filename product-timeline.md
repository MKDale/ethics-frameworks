# Product Lifecycle Timeline

### Prompt: 
“How do we intend this product will be used?”

### Action: 
Cross-functional or balanced team ideates for 5 minutes, in each of the 4 timeline areas.

### Why: 
Products aren’t always used as intended. Upon release and throughout its lifecycle the use of a product may change or include outcomes that were not necessarily intended due to its nature of being a part of a larger social ecosystem. As crafts people it is our responsibility to monitor & understand how a product is *actually* used in the real world, and not just assume intended outcomes. Whether we are the original creator or joined the product team at a later point in time, there should be a responsibility to knowing and being connected in this way.

### How: 
1. Draw a 2x4 grid on a large whiteboard. 
2. Down the left side, write from top to bottom: Today or Upon Release, One Year After Launch, Five Years After Launch, and Upon the Product’s Death/Sunset. 
3. Next, begin at the top going section by section, allowing 5 minutes for individual reflection around the coordinating questions. Use dark colored sharpies so they will be easily visible when placed at the wall. Write one idea per sticky note. 
4. Let the facilitator gather and group stickies at the board within the section. Let the conversation evolve before moving on to the next section below. Make sure _all_ voices and opinions are heard.
