# Do, Think, Feel, Say: Ecosystem

### Prompt: 
“How do we intend this product will be used?”

### Action: 
Cross-functional or balanced team ideates for 5 minutes, in each of the 4 timeline areas.

### Why: 
Products aren’t always used as intended. Upon release and throughout its lifecycle the use of a product may change or include outcomes that were not necessarily intended due to its nature of being a part of a larger social ecosystem. As crafts people it is our responsibility to monitor & understand how a product is *actually* used in the real world, and not just assume intended outcomes. Whether we are the original creator or joined the product team at a later point in time, there should be a responsibility to knowing and being connected in this way.
