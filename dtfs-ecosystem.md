These circles are then each divided into a cross-section of 4 different areas: _Think_ (understanding how each level is affects zeitgeist, implicit bias, world/political views, perception of others or groups of people, etc.), _Feel_ (understanding how each level is affects mental health, thoughts about themselves individually or collectively), _Say_ (understanding how each level affects speech, vocalization of opinions, or general communication), _Do_ (understanding how each level is affected in action or ability to engage).
3. With a balanced team formulate a structured discussion (open for small teams) or through individual ideation on stickies (structured for larger teams) starting at the innermost point within the circle, the individual, and working out toward global.
