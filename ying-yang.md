# Ying-Yang

According to the laws of unintended consequences, there will always be outcomes that we will overlook. How a product is used when it is first launched may change, for better, worse, or a mix of both, over the course of it's existence. Unintended does not have to mean unforeseeable though and we will not all arrive at the same conclusions or feel the same about the ethics of what we build together. No one can answer ethical dilemas for us, we have to answer them for ourselves. This exercise is intended to just bring awareness to the collective team and to prompt individuals to think of possible outcomes they may not have arrived at themselves.

### Phase I, How: 

1. Draw a 2x2 on a white board
2. Along the top label the left side, "In the Future" and on the right, "Now". Along the right side of the square, write the question, "How could this product be used or manipulated for positive outcomes?" next to the top row. Below, along the right side of the second row write the question, "How could this product be used or manipulated for malicious outcomes?".
3. Starting in the top right (now/good), dump stickies with a balanced, product team. One idea per sticky, 5 min total for each quadrant.
4. Go quadrant by quadrant, top to bottom - right to left. As the team finishes each quadrant, place sitickies inside of each quad and leave much room for discussion.
5. Talk until everyone feels heard but don't look for consensus or resolution.

### Phase II, How: 

Tie together. Recognize tension. Design around it. (Will develop more language around this soon). Next steps:

1. Everyone on the team does a silent read-through
2. Clump/Affinity Map similar items across quad border lines
3. Each item draw a small 2x2 (beneficial to biz against harmful to users) and plot a single point. [photo]
4. Run a 
[How Might We](http://www.designkit.org/methods/3) or [Solution Brainstorm](http://www.designkit.org/methods/1) exercise as a follow up to find ways to mitigate or consider how to design/build around highest ethical concerns.
