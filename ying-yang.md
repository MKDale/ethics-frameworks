# Ying-Yang

### Phase II, How: 
Tie together. Recognize tension. Design around it. (Will develop more language around this soon). Next steps:
Everyone on the team does a silent read-through
Clump/Affinity Map similar items across quad border lines
Each item draw a small 2x2 (beneficial to biz vs harmful to users??) and plot a single point.
Run a How Might We exercise as a follow up to find ways to mitigate or consider how to design/build around highest ethical concerns.
